/*
this is the bed which your pet would like to sleep on. (I hope) By using time zone of the current player
I can see when the dog should sleep (around the same hours as the person (im not completely sure how thats gonna work yet, 
but its an effort in progress))
Again, like most of the other js files, this should only appear when the time zone of the person is anytime after 9PM; uptil 6 or 7AM
in the morning
